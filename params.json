{"name":"Umbracoshell","body":"Please view the following README before downloading code:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis guide explains how to install Umbraco 5 locally and bootstrap the\r\ndevelopment process to get you up and running.\r\n\r\nThis guide uses the following software environment:\r\n\r\nWindows 7 64-bit\r\nGit\r\nIIS 7\r\nVisual Studio 2010 SP1\r\nMicrosoft MVC 3 Platform\r\nMS SQL Server 2008\r\n\r\nThis project will live in a repository here:\r\ngit@github.com:jeffstagg/UmbracoShell.git\r\n(link active as of May 9, 2012)\r\n\r\nPull the repository to your local machine.\r\n\r\nAfter pulling the repository, we'll set up our site in IIS.\r\nGo into IIS and create a new website with the name of your choice.\r\nThe physical path should be set to the location ~/UmbracoShell.Web\r\nIf you put the repo in c:\\dev\\, your selected folder should be:\r\nc:\\dev\\UmbracoShell\\UmbracoShell.Web\r\n\r\nChoose to start the site immediately.\r\nNow open your Application Pool and set IIS to run the site as a .Net 4.0 site.\r\n\r\nNext we'll need to set up the database. Open SQL Server Management Studio and\r\nconnect to your server. Create a new database by right-clicking the Databases\r\ndirectory and choosing Restore Database. In the dialog, enter a name for your\r\ndatabase in the To Database field. Select to restore from device, and add the\r\n.bak file included in this repository. This database has a user named 'admin'\r\nwhose password is 'admin'. You should create a new password for 'admin' after\r\nthis database is installed.\r\nClick 'ok' to install the database.\r\n\r\nOpen your solution in Visual Studio 2010, and build. If any references are\r\nfaulty, they will be stored in the ~/ReferenceDLLs directory to re-reference.\r\n\r\nNow open your ~/UmbracoShell.Web/connectionString.config and look for the connectionStrings\r\ntag. Under the name \"nhibernate.ConnString\", set the connection string to connect\r\nto your Umbraco database.\r\n\r\nWhen running in Visual Studio 2010, I've had mixed results in running a local\r\nversion of IIS, vs using IIS express through the VS project. Do not use the\r\ndefault server built into VS; there are problems getting Umbraco to run on it.\r\nIf you run this project locally on IIS7, you can begin using the package by\r\nbrowsing to the URL \"//localhost/umbraco\". If you get server errors, you may want\r\nto try using IIS Express through Visual Studio 2010. To do so, right-click on the\r\nUmbraco5Base.Web project in the solution explorer, and select Properties.\r\nChoose the Web tab, and under Servers, select the Use Local IIS Web Server\r\nradio button, and choose \"Use IIS Express\", leaving the Project Url to default.\r\nNow run the project through Visual Studio, and browse to ~/umbraco to begin\r\nusing the umbraco admin panel.\r\n\r\nWhen logging into Umbraco, the username / password is \"admin\" / \"admin\". You may\r\nnow begin building your site.\r\n","tagline":"Umbraco 5 base template with NUnit test project and Skeleton framework for VS 2010","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
